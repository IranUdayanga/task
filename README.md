The document provides a comprehensive guide for provisioning an Azure Key Vault using Terraform scripts and GitHub Actions. It outlines the steps to automate the deployment process and ensure consistency and reliability in managing Azure resources.

Here's a summary of the key points covered in the document:

Objective: The primary goal is to deploy an Azure Key Vault securely using Terraform and automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions.

Tools Used: The document utilizes Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) to define and provision Azure resources and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

Terraform Configuration: It provides Terraform configuration files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf) to define the Azure Key Vault resource, including its properties, such as name, location, access policies, and permissions.

GitHub Actions Workflow: A GitHub Actions workflow file (deploy_key_vault.yml) is included to automate the deployment process. It triggers the Terraform commands to initialize, plan, and apply the infrastructure changes.

Azure Service Principal: Guidance is provided on how to create an Azure service principal, which is required for authenticating Terraform with Azure during deployment. The document outlines steps for creating the service principal using Azure CLI or Azure Portal and obtaining the necessary credentials (client ID, client secret).

GitHub Secrets: It emphasizes the importance of securely storing sensitive information, such as service principal credentials, as GitHub Secrets. These secrets are then used within the GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate with Azure.

Execution: Instructions are provided on how to manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to initiate the deployment process. This includes navigating to the repository, selecting the appropriate workflow, and running it
